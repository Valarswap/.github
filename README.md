# What is ValarSwap ?

ValarSwap is a new decentralized exchange on Elrond designed for exchanging ESDT tokens.&#x20;

Like many DEXs, the protocol is based on an automated market maker (AMM) rather than an order book. This means that a user can swap assets at any time and does not need to wait for a buyer or seller.&#x20;

Thanks to the AMM, as soon as a swap occurs, the relative price of tokens gets updated.
