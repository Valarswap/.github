# APR and APY

The APR is the Annual Percent Rate. In simple terms it is the percentage of return the investor would get after one year.&#x20;

For example, if Alice invests 1000$ in a program that rewards her 10$ each month, then after one year she would get 120$, this is a 12% APR (120$/1000$). After the second year Alice would get another 120$ for those 1000$ that she initially invested.&#x20;

Now what if the investor wants to reinvest the 10$ earned each month ? This is called compounding interests. By doing so, each month he would earn more and more.&#x20;

For example after the first month Alice decides to reinvest the 10$, therefore the interests earned the second month are higher. Indeed the monthly returns of 1% (12% APR per year / 12 months), would yield 10.1$ the second month (1% of 1010$) instead of only 10$. And after one year of compounding each month she would get 126.83$ of return, hence 6.83$ more with compounding.&#x20;

This is called APY, Annual Percent Yield. Compounding gives an additional boost to the investment.&#x20;
