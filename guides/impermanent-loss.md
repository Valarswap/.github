# Impermanent Loss

Adding liquidity is subject to impermanent loss (IL for short). The price of one of the token of the pair can vary more importantly than the other, and represent a loss for the liquidity provider. It is called impermanent because the liquidity provider could wait for the price of that token to go back to a similar variation of the other token.

The ideal scenario for a liquidity provider is a pair for which both tokens move in unison. However, unless maybe for stable coin pairs, this is not what we typically observe. Therefore, liquidity providers need to be aware of IL and understand its implications.&#x20;
